# s3i - MSI Package Batch Installer 

This is a simple learning project I created to become familiar with .NET Core 3.0, 
its Windows/Linux binary portability and 
[FDE](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/#framework-dependent-executables-fde) 
application deployment model. 

Also, it gives an example of using certain features 
like continuous integrations with [AppVeyor](https://appveyor.com), 
and continuous deployment to [GitHub Releases](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/about-releases) - 
all completely free for open source projects!
